                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>I was tasked with exploring the possibilities in which a new app can find a place within the saturated cloud storage and organization market. Though the brief was open-ended, the client wanted the app to cover standard features, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>creating and organizing</strong> content</li>
                    <li><strong>uploading</strong> files from a computer or mobile device</li>
                    <li><strong>sharing</strong> a single item, or folder, with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
                    <li><strong>connecting</strong> with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>WWith this general brief, I had free reign to discover new angles to cloud organization and find the barriers and pain points that people encounter within existing apps.</p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>My solution to the brief is Crue, a cloud organization web and mobile app focused on group collaboration and organization. Crue aims to improve productivity by integrating apps you use regularly (like Google Drive or Dropbox) onto one platform. Not only does Crue store and help organize your files, but it also save links and allows you to collaborate with others. </p>

                <h3>Scouting out the lay of the land using surveys</h3>
                <p>To assess the state of cloud storage and learn how others use cloud apps, I created a user survey framed around the client’s brief. I sent it out to friends, colleagues, and the general public in hopes of tapping into new points of entry into the cloud app industry.</p>
                <p>The survey revealed these insights that I honed in on:</p>
                <p class="quote"><span class="percentage">98%</span> of participants benefit from using cloud storage services and apps in their daily and weekly lives, for both personal and work purposes. </p>
                <p>Many people cite <strong>convenience</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and <strong>ease of use</strong> as the top reasons they like to use the cloud. Cloud storage services often offer free storage, so many people also choose not to pay for it, even if they do need more than the storage space provided.</p>
                <p class="quote"><span class="percentage">75%</span> of participants use more than one cloud service (the most popular being Google Drive and Dropbox). </p>
                <p>The primary factor that guides peoples' choice of cloud services is what is already built into their phones and/or email service. For example, many people use Google Drive and Dropbox concurrently despite having similar capabilities. They use them for different purposes, such as personal vs. work, photo storage vs. document storage, and so on. I learned that people tend to want to try new services based on how a company positions and sells their service.</p>
                <p>Although the market seems saturated, cloud storage is still fairly new to the general public. These insights made me wonder if it would be beneficial to be able to integrate existing cloud apps to help consolidate the many cloud apps. This is an idea that I kept in the back of my mind as I forged ahead. </p>

                <h3>Developing user stories</h3>
                <p>With knowledge of client needs and guidance from the user survey, I was able to prioritize the features that the participants thought were most important to help establish user stories. I broke it down to the high (H), medium (M), and low (L) priority stories focused on new and returning users.</p>
                <h4>User Stories</h4>

I interviewed three people (from the user survey) over the phone to talk more in-depth about their experiences with cloud storage. From their background and insights, I created these personas to establish our target audience: Startup Creative, Career Changer, Jack of All Trades.</p>

                <h3>Looking outwards to competitors</h3>
                <p>I performed a competitive analysis on a diverse range of cloud storage platforms, all bringing something different to the table. I analyzed <strong>Dropbox</strong> because it is one of the top cloud storage options, <strong>Evernote</strong> for its different approach (note-taking) to cloud storage and <strong>Egnyte</strong> for its specific focus on security and enterprise.</p>

                <p>From the analysis, a new competitor can enter this marketplace by taking some cues from Evernote and Egnyte. Evernote positions itself in a unique way (focus on note-making and list-taking), while Egnyte integrates existing apps that already work well so that there’s no need to re-create the wheel. Attempting to be an all-in-one solution like Dropbox was out of the question, but they are a good reference in terms of design and key features. For a new company, I hypothesized that efforts and money would be best suited to <strong>targeting a niche group</strong> or <strong>solving a very specific problem</strong> in the cloud storage industry.</p>

                <h3>Thinking through user flows</h3>
                <p>To construct the app’s user flows, I first studied and took notes on the way Dropbox, Evernote, and Egnyte designed common flows (such as sign up, log in, and uploading files). I started my flows on paper and pencil to quickly riff on different ways to achieve one task (user story). By the time I create the flows digitally, I chose the flows that seemed most intuitive and straightforward. I used this as a basis to think logically and conditionally throughout. It took continual refining past the wireframes stage and beyond to get it right.</p>

                <p>This discovery and research phase allowed me to structure the problem presented by the client’s brief and helped shape the path forward. The user research helped me see what tasks and features were most important. This helped direct focus towards thoughtful solutions to the problems that would make the biggest impact in experience. With user insights gathered, stories prioritized, and some ideas on how to meet the client’s and user needs, it was time to dive into creating a new product.</p>

                <h3>Low-fidelity wireframes</h3>
                <h4>Usability Test Round 1</h4>
                <p>Armed with user research, stories, and personas, I build out the app with wireframes to start testing on real people in-person and remotely. The <strong>first round of usability tests</strong> highlighted many pain points of the preliminary layouts and the user flows to complete the following tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Signing up for an account</li>
                    <li>Creating a doc (content)</li>
                    <li>Organizing a file or folder</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The primary issues involved the <strong>landing page's content strategy</strong> (making it more sellable) and <strong>improving the flow</strong> for organizing a file. </p>
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/330x520" alt="Snapshot of landing page">
                <p>The copy on the landing page was on the generic side and focused on getting the user to sign up for a paid app (which made the participants reluctant and wary). </p>
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/330x520" alt="dashboard screen">
                <p>Many participants also found “organizing a file” challenging to execute, so I would need to go back and revamp the flow. There were also small things I missed (e.g., the legal checkbox to accept privacy policy and terms) that forced me to study existing sign up more carefully.</p>

                <p>Between the first and second round of usability tests, I did extensive A/B testing on a variety of design stylings from file menu placement to landing page backgrounds. I also gathered feedback from other designers to how to improve the visual design and interactions. The effort to put designs out there for testing and feedback allowed me to iterate and validate quickly. This allowed me to experiment on many variations on macro and micro design elements to get to the best solution in an extensive 2-week period. </p>

                <h3>High-fidelity prototype</h3>
                <h4>Usability test round 2</h4>
                <p>When it came time to do the second usability tests on hi-fidelity mockups, the results were very positive. The high-fidelity mockups addressed a lot of the issues that arose in the first round regarding the lack of uniqueness of the landing page and the friction within the flow of organizing files. Some notable feedback were:</p>
                <quote>...I love the aesthetic and the use of icons is very helpful. Integrating everything seems very cool.</quote>
                <quote>My mind feels at ease because it’s simpler. I like that the file menu pops up on the side more noticeably compared to other apps where it can be tiny or hard to find.</quote>
                <quote>The color palette is pleasing and the design feels unified.  I like the small details like the arrow icon which left a nice trail of digital breadcrumbs. </quote>
                <p>I attribute the successes to the thorough testing and iteration in preparation for usability testing. It was definitely worth it push it further and rework the screens as needed. The changes made to the final product were minimal and mostly polishing up formatting and consistency. I don’t think the final design is perfect by any means, but it’s a fairly good solution that is clean, intuitive and feels enjoyable to use. </p>

                <h3>Branding & logo design</h3>
                <p>For Crue's brand, I came up with the logo design, style guide, and illustrations for the landing page. All these elements together can easily be extended to develop a visual design system that is adaptable to Crue’s growth as a brand and product.</p>

                <p>The name Crue was derived from "accrue" meaning growth and increase, and "crew" meaning group of people. This name was chosen because it captures a feeling of togetherness and growth. The four letter name is also easy to remember. </p>

                <h4>Style guide</h4>
                <p>In the style guide, I went with a vibrant and colorful route, using gradients and bright hues to give a friendly and warm vibe. The gradient in the letter C represents harmony and collaboration. The other shapes (square, triangle, and circle) are solid colors to represent different ideas and people coming together to synthesize with the letter C. The vibrancy of the colors also seemed to match the casual and fun tone of the content strategy (brand voice). Since the logo is so expressive and bold, the color and type treatments to the rest of the web app will be more neutral to bring balance to the overall design.</p>

                <h4>Landing page illustrations</h4>
                <p>After developing the logo, I became inspired by the geometric shapes within the logo and thought of ways to incorportate the motif throughout the app. I decided to push my skills and venture into creating digital illustrations in a loose pen style for the landing page. I wanted to bring texture and a creative energy to the page. It was something simple that I wanted to try my hand at and it ended up working well. </p>

            <h2><span>05</span>   Takeaways</h2>            
            <p>Developing Crue from idea to prototype was a comprehensive process that provided many lessons for future iterations and projects. A few of those lessons were:</p>
            <p><strong>There's always going to be something to do, whether it's to design or test on. </strong><br>
            When one starts getting lost in the weeds, refer back to user stories and priorities to bring focus. In this case, MVP is what we're going after so it's really important to hone in on high-priority stories. On top of that, you'll need to consider deadlines, which makes this even more critical that you're not wasting time making everything little thing functional. </p>
            <p><strong>Don't force uncommon patterns for the sake of being different.</strong><br>
            Of course, this is not to be applied generally. When the goal is innovation, trying unconventional routes is encouraged. However, there are just some things that users are used to, and straying from that can create dissonance. Simpler is, for most of the time, better. </p>
            <p><strong>Small things that help direct the users' focus can go a long way.</strong><br>
            When studying existing apps and common design patterns, one of the main things that seemed to make an experience exceptional was how well it directed the user's focus. This seems to play a large role in reducing cognitive load. In Crue, I made conscious decisions to use visual cues like arrows and graying out options or part of the screen. This made the app super clear and allowed users to go through flows easily.</p>
