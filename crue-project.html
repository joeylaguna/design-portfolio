                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>I was tasked with exploring the possibilities in which a new app can find a place within the saturated cloud storage and organization market. Though the brief was open-ended, the client wanted the app to cover standard features, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>creating and organizing</strong> content</li>
                    <li><strong>uploading</strong> files from a computer or mobile device</li>
                    <li><strong>sharing</strong> a single item, or folder, with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
                    <li><strong>connecting</strong> with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With this general brief, I had free reign to discover new angles to cloud organization and find the barriers and pain points that people in using existing apps.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>My solution to the brief is Crue, a cloud organization web and mobile app focused on group collaboration and organization. Crue strives to increase productivity by integrating apps you regularly use, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, onto one platform. Crue <strong>stores and organizes your files</strong>, allows you to <strong>save links</strong>, and <strong>collaborate with others</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Scouting out the lay of the land using surveys</h2>
                <p>To assess the cloud storage market and how people use cloud apps, I created a user survey framed around the client’s brief. I sent it out to friends, colleagues, and the general public to tap into new points of entry and learn current behaviors. From the results, I honed in on these two insights:</p>
                <blockquote class="insights"><span class="percentage">98%</span> of participants benefit from using cloud storage services & apps in their daily and weekly lives, for personal and work purposes.</blockquote>
                <p>Many people cite <strong>convenience</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and <strong>ease of use</strong> as the top reasons they like to use the cloud.</p>
                <blockquote class="insights"><span class="percentage">75%</span> of participants use more than one cloud service (the most popular being Google Drive and Dropbox).</blockquote>
                <p>The primary factor that guides peoples' choice of cloud services is what is already built into their phones and/or email service (e.g., Google Drive)</p>
                <p><strong>Assumption debunked:</strong> the market <em>seems</em> saturated, but cloud storage is still fairly new to the general public. Going through the results made me wonder if there was some way to consolidate existing cloud apps to help people manage their accounts better. I kept these ideas in the back of my mind as I forged ahead.</p>

                <h2>Developing user stories</h2>

I broke it down to the high , medium , and low  priority stories focused on <strong>new</strong> and <strong>returning</strong> users.</p>

Egnyte already has integrations with robust document creation apps (Microsoft 365 and G Suite) so that there’s no need to re-create the wheel. Adopting the way they’ve executed their marketing and features can direct us to a solution that’s right for our audience.</p>

                <p>Armed with user research, stories, and personas, I build out the app with wireframes and started testing right away on real people in-person and remotely. The first round of usability tests highlighted the <em>inconsistencies of the preliminary layouts</em> and <em>pain points in completing the following tasks:</em> signing up for an account, creating a doc (content), organizing a file or folder.</p>
                <p>The primary issues involved the landing page's content strategy (making it more sellable) and improving the flow for organizing a file/folder. </p>

I gathered feedback from other designers to improve visual design and interactions. The effort to put designs out there for testing and feedback allowed me to experiment, iterate, and validate quickly to get to the best solution within a intensive 2-week period.</p>

                <h2>High-fidelity prototype</h2>
                <p>When it came time to do usability tests on high-fidelity mockups, the results were very positive. The high-fidelity mockups addressed many of the issues that arose in the first round regarding the lack of uniqueness of the landing page and the friction within the flow of organizing files. Some notable feedback were:</p>
                <blockquote>My mind feels at ease because it’s simpler. I like that the file menu pops up on the side more noticeably compared to other apps where it can be tiny or hard to find.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <blockquote>The color palette is pleasing and the design feels unified.  I like the small details like the arrow icon which left a nice trail of digital breadcrumbs. </blockquote>
                <p>I attribute the successes to the thorough and focused testing and iteration. It was worth it rework the screens as needed. The changes made to the final product were minimal and mostly polishing up formatting and consistency. I don’t think the final design is perfect by any means, but it’s a fairly good solution that is clean, intuitive and feels enjoyable to use.</p>

                <h2>Branding & logo design</h2>
                <p>For the Crue brand, I developed a logo design, style guide, and illustrations for the landing page. All these elements together can easily be extended to develop a visual design system that is adaptable to Crue’s growth as a brand and product.</p>

                <p>The name Crue was derived from "accrue" meaning growth and increase, and "crew" meaning group of people. This name was chosen because it captures a feeling of togetherness and growth. The four letter name is also easy to remember. </p>
                <p><strong>Brand traits:</strong> flexible, friendly, warm, collaborative, and organized</p>

            <div class="style-guide">
                <h2>Style guide</h2>
                <p>For the overall style guide, I went with a vibrant and colorful route, using gradients and bright hues to give a friendly and warm vibe. In the logo, the gradient in the letter C represents harmony and collaboration. The other shapes (square, triangle, and circle) are solid colors to represent different ideas and people coming together to synthesize with the letter C. Since the logo is so expressive and bold, the color and type treatments to the rest of the web app are more neutral to bring balance to the overall design.</p>

                <h2>Landing page illustrations</h2>
                <p>After developing the logo, I became inspired by the geometric shapes within it. I wanted to find ways to incorporate the motif throughout. I pushed my skills and ventured into creating simple digital illustrations in a loose pen style. Fortunately, my gamble worked out as the illustrations helped bring texture and creative energy to the landing page.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>            
            <p>Developing Crue from idea to prototype was a comprehensive process that provided many lessons for future iterations and projects. A few of those lessons were:</p>
            <p><strong>There's always going to be something to do, whether it's to design or test on.</strong><br>
            When you start getting lost in the weeds, refer back to user stories and priorities to bring focus. In this case, MVP is what we're going after so it's really important to hone in on high-priority stories. On top of that, you'll need to consider deadlines, which makes this even more critical that you're not wasting time making everything little thing functional.</p>
            <p><strong>Don't force uncommon patterns for the sake of being different.</strong><br>
                Of course, this is not to be applied generally. When the goal is innovation, trying unconventional routes is encouraged. However, there are just some things that users are used to, and straying from that can create dissonance. Simpler is better.</p>
            <p><strong>Small things that help direct the users' focus can go a long way.</strong><br>
                When studying other apps and common design patterns, one of the techniques that helped make exceptional experiences was how well it directed the user's focus with small details. This seems to play a large role in reducing cognitive load. In Crue, I made conscious decisions to use visual cues like arrows and graying out options or part of the screen. This allowed users to go through flows easily.</p>
