                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>The client approached me with this project to explore the possibilities in which a new app can find a place within the saturated cloud storage and organization market. We hypothesized that we can solve this problem with the right combination of features that could meet the needs of a target audience. Though the brief was somewhat open-ended, the client wanted the app to at least cover standard features, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>creating and organizing that content</li>
                    <li>uploading files from a computer or mobile device</li>
                    <li>sharing a single item, or folder, with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
                    <li>connecting with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With this brief, I was open to tackling the challenging task of discovering new angles to approach cloud organization and finding the barriers and pain points that people encounter with existing apps.</p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>My solution to the brief is Crue, a cloud organization web and mobile app focused on group collaboration and organization. Crue aims to improve productivity by integrating apps you use regularly (like Google Drive or Dropbox) onto one platform. Not only does Crue store and help organize your files, but it also save links and allows you to collaborate with others. </p>

                <h2>Getting the lay of the land</h2>
                <p>As someone who is generally tech-savvy and regularly uses cloud tools, I wanted to test against my notions and learn how others use cloud apps. To assess the state of cloud storage from other users perspective, I sent out a user survey. I framed it around the client’s brief to discover new points of entry into the cloud app industry. </p>
                <p>The survey revealed these insights that I honed in on:</p>
                <p><strong>98%</strong> of participants benefit from using cloud storage services and apps in their daily and weekly lives, for both personal and work purposes. </p>
                <p>Many people cite convenience, accessibility, and ease of use as the top reasons they like to use the cloud. It's standard for cloud storage services to offer limited space for free, so many people choose not to pay for a cloud service, even if they do want more storage space. </p>
                <p><strong>75%</strong> of participants use more than one cloud service (the most popular being Google Drive and Dropbox). </p>
                <p>The main factor that guides peoples' choice over the other cloud services and apps were what was already built into the phones, email service, and other digital products they already use. Instead of comparing options and choosing one, it's easier to adopt new services based on how they sell their cloud storage. Although the market seems saturated, cloud storage is still fairly new to the general public. This could explain why participants are receptive to new features involving collaboration, video/image-editing, and in-app messaging. For example, many people use Google Drive and Dropbox concurrently. Although both have the same or similar capabilities in terms of storing files, people still used them for different purposes (personal vs work, photo storage vs document storage). </p>
                <p>These insights made me wonder if it would be beneficial to be able to integrate existing cloud apps to help consolidate the many cloud apps. This is an idea that I kept in the back of my mind as I moved forward. For more in-depth information, read the full analysis here:</p>

                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/685x275" alt="Screenshot of user stories">
                <p>With knowledge of client needs and guidance from the user survey, we were able to prioritize the features that the participants thought were most important to help establish user stories. I broke it down to focus on the high, medium, and low priority stories for new and returning users: </p>

            <div class="research-wrapup">
                <p>This discovery and research phase allowed me to structure the problem presented by the client’s brief. Since the brief was open-ended, the research helped shape the path forward. The user researched helped me see what tasks and features were most important. This helped direct focus towards thoughtful solutions to the problems that would make the biggest impact in experience. With user insights gathered, stories prioritized, and some ideas on how to meet the client’s needs, it was time to dive into learning about existing apps and common patterns to help us construct the beginnings of a new product.</p>

            <div class="competitive-analysis">
                <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
                <p>I performed a competitive analysis on a diverse range of cloud storage platforms, all bringing something different to the table. I analyzed Dropbox because it is one of the top cloud storage options, Evernote for its different approach (note-taking) to cloud storage and Egnyte for its specific focus on security and enterprise.</p>
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/220" alt="Dropbox logo">
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/220" alt="Evernote logo">
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/220" alt="Egnyte logo">
                <p>From the analysis, a new competitor can enter this marketplace by taking a different angle to cloud storage, similar to Evernote's approach and integrating existing apps (no need to re-create the wheel) that already work well like the way Egnyte has. It's a big undertaking to aim to be an all-in-one solution like Dropbox, who have been tackling the cloud storage problems for many years. For a new company, we confirmed that efforts and money would be better suited to targeting a niche group or focusing on solving a specific problem in the cloud storage industry.</p>
                <p>For a view of the full analysis:</p>
                <button>View SWOT Analysis</button>
                <p>The competitive analysis highlighted how important business marketing and positioning is. Many of the apps have overlapping functionalities, but they all cater to a specific audience and purpose. This will be important to keep in mind when it comes to content strategy, copywriting, and branding for a specific target audience.</p>

            <div class="user-flows">
                <h2>User flows</h2>
                <p>To construct the app’s user flows, I first studied the way Dropbox, Evernote, and Egnyte designed common flows (such as sign up, log in, and uploading files) and took notes. I started on paper and pencil to be able to riff on different ways to achieve one task (user story). By the time I got to create my flows digitally, I used the flows that seemed the most common (familiar) or was simple and straightforward. </p>
                <button>View All Flows</button>
                <p>Though I put in work to organize all these user flows, I was still able to find simpler ways to complete tasks (with fewer clicks) during wireframes stage and beyond. I learned that designing and improving flows is something you have to continually work at throughout the process. This is just a start to get the brain to start thinking logically and conditionally.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The user survey gave me great quantitative data to work from, but now it’s time to gather more qualitative data through user personas. I interviewed three people from the user survey to talk more in-depth about their experiences with cloud storage. From their background and insights, I created these personas to establish a target audience for our web app: Renaissance Man, Career Changer, Startup Creative.</p>
                <p>Overall, our target audience is between the ages of 22-35 who are somewhat- to highly- tech-savvy. They also use cloud apps for varying purposes such as sharing files with clients, freeing up space on their hard drive, and storing photos.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest takeaways was the different ways that each participant used the apps and their functionalities. For example, two of them only accessed their cloud app through the web portal, opting out of using desktop apps. This conveyed that an effective app should to be flexible to work styles by allowing people to execute tasks in multiple ways. One way to do address this is to be considerate of ways people choose to access their files due to circumstances like optimizing hard drive space, not wanting to download another app, or if it makes sense with the file types they’re using (e.g., Google Drive).</p>

                <p>LO-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</p>
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/685x250" alt="Wireframes preview">
                <p>Armed with user research, stories, and personas, I build out the app with wireframes to start testing on real people in-person and remotely. The <strong>first round of usability tests</strong> highlighted many pain points of the preliminary layouts and the user flows to complete the following tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Signing up for an account</li>
                    <li>Creating a doc (content)</li>
                    <li>Organizing a file or folder</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The primary issues involved the landing page's content strategy (making it more sellable) and improving the flow for the last task (organizing a file). The copy on the landing page was a little on the generic side and focused on getting the user to sign up for a paid app (which made the participants reluctant and wary). Many participants also found “organizing a file” challenging to execute, so I would need to go back and revamp the flow. There were also small things I missed (e.g., the legal checkbox to accept privacy policy and terms) that forced me to study existing sign up more carefully.

                <h4>A/B (Preference) Testing on Visuals Stylings</h4>
                File Menu Placement
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350" alt="File menu placement on bottom">A. bottom menu = <strong>8%</strong>
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350" alt="File menu placement on right">B. right side menu = <strong>92%</strong>
                <p>Between the first and second round of usability tests, I did extensive A/B testing on a variety of design stylings from file menu placement to landing page backgrounds. I also gathered feedback from other designers to how to improve the visual design and interactions. The effort to put designs out there for testing and feedback allowed me to iterate and validate quickly. This allowed me to experiment on many variations on macro and micro design elements to get to the best solution in an extensive 2-week period. </p>
                <h4>HI-FIDELITY MOCKUPS</h4>

                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350" alt="Create document view">
                <p>When it came time to do the second usability tests on hi-fidelity mockups, the results were very positive. I attribute the successes to the thorough testing and iteration in preparation for usability testing. It was definitely worth it to push out the designs and work on them. The changes made to the final product were minimal and mostly polishing up formatting and consistency. I don’t think the final design is perfect by any means, but it’s a fairly good solution that is clean, intuitive and feels enjoyable to use. </p>
