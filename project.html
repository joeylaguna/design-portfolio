                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>The client approached me with this project to explore the possibilities in which a new app can find a place within the saturated cloud storage and organization market. We hypothesized that we can solve this problem with the right combination of features that could meet the needs of a target audience. Though the brief was somewhat open-ended, the client wanted the app to at least cover standard features, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>creating and organizing that content</li>
                    <li>uploading files from a computer or mobile device</li>
                    <li>sharing a single item, or folder, with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
                    <li>connecting with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With this brief, I was open to tackling the challenging task of discovering new angles to approach cloud organization and finding the barriers and pain points that people encounter with existing apps.</p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>My solution to the brief is Crue, a cloud organization web and mobile app focused on group collaboration and organization. Crue aims to improve productivity by integrating apps you use regularly (like Google Drive or Dropbox) onto one platform. Not only does Crue store and help organize your files, but it also save links and allows you to collaborate with others. </p>

                <h2>Getting the lay of the land</h2>
                <p>As someone who is generally tech-savvy and regularly uses cloud tools, I wanted to test against my notions and learn how others use cloud apps. To assess the state of cloud storage from other users perspective, I sent out a user survey. I framed it around the client’s brief to discover new points of entry into the cloud app industry. </p>
                <p>The survey revealed these insights that I honed in on:</p>
                <p><strong>98%</strong> of participants benefit from using cloud storage services and apps in their daily and weekly lives, for both personal and work purposes. </p>
                <p>Many people cite convenience, accessibility, and ease of use as the top reasons they like to use the cloud. It's standard for cloud storage services to offer limited space for free, so many people choose not to pay for a cloud service, even if they do want more storage space. </p>
                <p><strong>75%</strong> of participants use more than one cloud service (the most popular being Google Drive and Dropbox). </p>
                <p>The main factor that guides peoples' choice over the other cloud services and apps were what was already built into the phones, email service, and other digital products they already use. Instead of comparing options and choosing one, it's easier to adopt new services based on how they sell their cloud storage. Although the market seems saturated, cloud storage is still fairly new to the general public. This could explain why participants are receptive to new features involving collaboration, video/image-editing, and in-app messaging. For example, many people use Google Drive and Dropbox concurrently. Although both have the same or similar capabilities in terms of storing files, people still used them for different purposes (personal vs work, photo storage vs document storage). </p>
                <p>These insights made me wonder if it would be beneficial to be able to integrate existing cloud apps to help consolidate the many cloud apps. This is an idea that I kept in the back of my mind as I moved forward. For more in-depth information, read the full analysis here:</p>

            <h2>User stories</h2>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/685x275" alt="Screenshot of user stories">
            <p>With knowledge of client needs and guidance from the user survey, we were able to prioritize the features that the participants thought were most important to help establish user stories. I broke it down to focus on the high, medium, and low priority stories for new and returning users: </p>

            <p>This discovery and research phase allowed me to structure the problem presented by the client’s brief. Since the brief was open-ended, the research helped shape the path forward. The user researched helped me see what tasks and features were most important. This helped direct focus towards thoughtful solutions to the problems that would make the biggest impact in experience. With user insights gathered, stories prioritized, and some ideas on how to meet the client’s needs, it was time to dive into learning about existing apps and common patterns to help us construct the beginnings of a new product.</p>
