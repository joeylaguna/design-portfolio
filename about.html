            <img src="" alt="Smiling Filipino girl wearing glasses">
            <p>My multicultural upbringing as a <a href="">1.5 generation</a> immigrant and Navy brat has largely shaped who I am today, both as a designer and as a person. My immigrant experience between cultures, growing up in the Philippines, Japan, and the U.S., cultivated empathy within me while witnessing my parents uproot our family every 3-4 years instilled resilience and a strong work ethic. Similar to many creatives, a love for art was the start. I became a designer through sheer will and quiet stubbornness to keep creativity a part of my daily routine. In a sense, I was determined to never grow up.</p>
            <p>Some of my first ‚Äúdesign‚Äù memories were from the early 2000s. For a time, I was addicted to designing layouts on Xanga. I messed around with bootleg Photoshop and tweaked hodgepodge HTML/CSS. I risked sneaking into the computer room past my bedtime and muffling the dial-up modem with a pillow‚Äîall so I could launch a new layout design featuring The Killers' newest single. It was adorned with flowery swashes, distressed edges, and lyrics of "Mr. Brightside". I'd wake up the next day to new eProps and gushing comments from my little internet community. It was thrilling to be able to use my creativity, love for music, and shoddy technical ability to make something that people actually liked!</p>

            <p>After getting a Design degree from UC Davis, I worked as a graphic designer for a couple of years. My favorite job was working at a translation agency where I helped make election materials and health documents more accessible to non-English speaking demographics and screen-reader users. I felt like I was making a difference, but I wondered how much? Are people actually using these tools? How are they accessing them? What can we do better? I wanted to find out, but as much as our team tried to bring in context and research, the choice was ultimately left to the client and the questions remained unanswered. </p>
            <p>For two years, I slowly transitioned into product design, attending conferences to learn about issues surrounding tech and applying my learnings at hackathons. Eventually, I made the decision to pursue UX design in order to find answers to those types of questions that I had before. I yearned to be able to contribute both creatively and analytically to the design process, so I took it upon myself to enroll in Bloc's Design Apprenticeship. Shortly after, I collaborated with a small group of colleagues in establishing a design learning community in Sacramento to help other designers grow. Through UX design, I aspire to serve marginalized and underserved communities to improve their quality of life. It won't be easy, and I'm just getting started.</p>
