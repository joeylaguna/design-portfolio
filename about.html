    <h2>Hey there üëãüèº <br>You can call me Kimberly</h2>
    <h4>Kimberly Gail is my first name, KGRL are my initials</h4>
    <img src="" alt="Smiling Filipino girl wearing glasses">
    <p>My multicultural upbringing as a <a href="">1.5 generation</a> immigrant and Navy brat has largely shaped who I am today, both as a designer and as a person. My immigrant experience between cultures, growing up in the Philippines, Japan, and the U.S., cultivated empathy within me while witnessing my parents uproot our family every 3-4 years instilled resilience and a strong work ethic. Similar to many creatives, a love for art was the start. I became a designer through sheer will and quiet stubbornness to keep creativity a part of my daily routine. In a sense, I was determined to never grow up.</p>
    <p>Some of my first ‚Äúdesign‚Äù memories were from the early 2000s. For a time, I was addicted to designing layouts on Xanga. I messed around with bootleg Photoshop and tweaked hodgepodge HTML/CSS. I risked sneaking into the computer room past my bedtime and muffling the dial-up modem with a pillow‚Äîall so I could launch a new layout design featuring The Killers' newest single. It was adorned with flowery swashes, distressed edges, and lyrics of "Mr. Brightside". I'd wake up the next day to new eProps and gushing comments from my little internet community. It was thrilling to be able to use my creativity, love for music, and shoddy technical ability to make something that people actually liked!</p>
